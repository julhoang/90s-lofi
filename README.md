# 90s-Lofi Inspired Website
This project was created as part of the AE 322 - Digital Arts course, where we explored the intersection of technology and creativity by using ChatGPT to assist in building a complete website.

## Overview
The website draws inspiration from the nostalgic 90s lo-fi aesthetic, incorporating elements reminiscent of that era's web design. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site offers a retro experience in both style and interaction. Itâ€™s best viewed on desktop, as the design is not responsive to mobile devices.

## Theme
While the visual design evokes the 90s lo-fi aesthetic, the website's content is forward-looking, centered around the theme of "Futures I Want to Run Towards." This blend of past and future creates a unique contrast that reflects both nostalgia and ambition.
